# FarSend

**Multi-chain batch sender for ETH and ERC-20 tokens — built for Farcaster.**

🚀 **Live App**: [https://farsend.vercel.app/](https://farsend.vercel.app/)

---

## Overview

FarSend is a web-based batch sender that enables users to send ETH and ERC-20 tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction across multiple Ethereum networks. Built as a Farcaster Mini App, FarSend streamlines token distributions for airdrops, community rewards, DAO payouts, and bulk transfers on Ethereum Mainnet, Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum.

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Batch Sending
- Send ETH or ERC-20 tokens to multiple addresses in one transaction
- Significantly reduce gas costs compared to individual transfers
- Streamline airdrops and reward distributions

### 🔗 Wallet Integration
- Connect with any Web3 wallet via Reown AppKit
- Non-custodial — your keys never leave your wallet
- Direct wallet-to-wallet transfers
- Automatic network detection and switching to Base

### 📊 Smart Input & Validation
- **Manual Entry**: Paste addresses and amounts line-by-line
- **CSV/JSON Upload**: Import recipient lists from files
- **Live Preview**: See parsed data before dispatching
- **Address Validation**: Automatic Ethereum address checksumming
- **Balance Checks**: Verify sufficient funds before sending

### 🎯 ERC-20 Token Support
- Send any ERC-20 token on Base
- Automatic token contract validation
- Built-in approval workflow for token spending
- Display token symbol and decimals

### 🌐 Farcaster Integration
- Native Farcaster Mini App
- Launch directly from Farcaster clients
- Optimized for mobile and desktop experiences

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Progress Stepper**: Visual workflow (Connect → Define → Dispatch)
- **Real-time Summaries**: See recipient count and total amounts
- **Transaction Tracking**: Direct links to BaseScan for all transactions
- **Success Celebrations**: Confetti animations on successful batches
- **Export Functionality**: Download recipient lists as CSV

---

## How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**  
   Connect your Web3 wallet and ensure you're on Base Mainnet (Chain ID 8453)

2. **Define Token & Recipients**  
   - Select ETH or enter an ERC-20 token contract address
   - Input recipients manually or upload a CSV/JSON file
   - Format: `address, amount` per line

3. **Review & Dispatch**  
   - Review the summary (recipient count, total amount, token details)
   - For ERC-20 tokens, approve spending if needed
   - Click "Dispatch Batch" to send the transaction
   - Confirm in your wallet and wait for on-chain confirmation

- **Wallet Connection**: Reown AppKit (formerly WalletConnect)
- **Blockchain**: Base (Ethereum L2) - Chain ID 8453
- **Smart Contract**: Custom BaseBatchSender for gas-optimized batch transfers
- **Social Layer**: Farcaster Mini App SDK
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Smart Contract

FarSend uses a batch sender contract that is deployed once per supported chain. The full source is in **[`BatchSender.sol`](BatchSender.sol)** — the standard, stateless "Disperse" pattern with **no owner, no upgrade path, and no withdraw function**, so it can only ever move funds to the exact recipients the caller specifies.

**Functions**:
- `disperseEther(address[] recipients, uint256[] amounts)` - Batch send ETH (payable, refunds leftover)
- `disperseToken(address token, address[] recipients, uint256[] amounts)` - Batch send ERC-20 tokens

Per-chain addresses are defined in `public/chains.json`. The ABI is identical across all deployments, so:

- Existing chains do **not** need to be redeployed.
- To support a new chain, simply deploy the same `BatchSender.sol` on it and add its address + RPC to `public/chains.json` — no frontend code change required.

## Development

### Testing & Code Quality

The core logic is extracted into pure, unit-tested modules under `src/core/` (no DOM/wallet dependencies). Run them locally:

```bash
npm test              # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run check:chains  # validate chains.json + drift vs AppKit networks
npm run build         # production build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs syntax checks, chain-config validation, unit tests, and the production build on every push/PR.

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/farsend.git
cd farsend
```

2. Serve locally (any static file server works)
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Configuration

The app loads the chain + contract configuration from `public/chains.json`:

```json
{
  "chains": {
    "8453": {
      "name": "Base",
      "chainId": 8453,
      "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.base.org",
      "explorerUrl": "https://basescan.org",
      "nativeCurrency": { "symbol": "ETH", "decimals": 18 },
      "contractAddress": "0x8878b70a01bdda92ab8ea48dd7893b64c69298c0"
    }
  },
  "abi": [...]
}
```

Add a new chain by appending an entry (with the same ABI) and deploying `BatchSender.sol` there.

### Deployment

Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel deploy
```

The app includes a `vercel.json` configuration for proper routing and redirects.

## Farcaster Mini App Integration

FarSend is registered as a Farcaster Mini App and can be launched directly from Farcaster clients.

**Manifest**: `/.well-known/farcaster.json`  
**App URL**: `https://farsend.vercel.app`  
**Splash Screen**: Custom animated loading screen with brand identity

---

## Gas Optimization

FarSend uses a custom batch sender contract that optimizes gas usage:

- **Single transaction**: All transfers execute in one on-chain transaction
- **Efficient loops**: Optimized Solidity loops for minimal gas overhead
- **No unnecessary storage**: Contract uses minimal state storage
- **Direct transfers**: ETH sent directly without intermediate steps

**Typical gas savings**: 40-60% compared to individual transfers for batches of 10+ recipients

---
